Course Title: Introduction to MongoDB
Course Code: MONGODB101

Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database management system. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of MongoDB, its architecture, and how to work with document-oriented databases. The course will cover data modeling, querying techniques, indexing, and basic database administration tasks.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Understand the fundamental concepts of NoSQL databases and their advantages.
2. Design and implement a data model using MongoDB's document-oriented approach.
3. Write queries and aggregation pipelines to retrieve and manipulate data in MongoDB.
4. Apply indexing techniques for optimizing query performance.
5. Implement basic database administration tasks, such as user management and data backup/restore operations.
6. Identify and troubleshoot common issues related to MongoDB deployments.
