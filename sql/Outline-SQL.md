Course Title: Introduction to SQL
Course Code: SQL101

Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL), a powerful tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. Students will learn the fundamentals of SQL syntax, database design, and querying techniques. The course will also cover data definition and manipulation, as well as basic database administration concepts.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Understand the fundamental concepts of databases and their role in information management.
2. Write basic SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete data from a relational database.
3. Design and create a well-structured relational database schema.
4. Apply advanced SQL techniques, such as joins and subqueries, to retrieve and manipulate complex data sets.
5. Implement basic database administration tasks, such as user management and backup/restore operations.
6. Identify and troubleshoot common issues related to SQL queries and database performance.
