COMP.6212 First Day SQL Exercise
--------------------------------

In this exercise we create a table to store customer list.
We add data
We use this data to practice the basic db functions of add edit delete sort search filter.
You will need to speak SQL if you want to work with data, feel free to learn as little (CRUD, AEDSSF and table relationships) or as much as you want!
I recommend saving any scripts that work to a txt file.

We will use sqlite3 fiddle in the broswer to run the commands but you can use any sqlite3 instance you want.

------ Some commands to get started ---

CREATE TABLE customers(id, cust_name, cust_surname);

.tables --(this is SQLite3 command not SQL - starts with dot doesn't end with semi colon) --

INSERT INTO customers values (1, 'Andy ','Haden');

SELECT rowid, id, cust_name FROM customers;

.mode table

INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Brian', 'Willians');

INSERT INTO customers VALUES (3, 'Sid', 'Going'), (4, 'Robbie', 'Deans'),(5, 'Mack','Herewini');

-----

-- Now add edit delete sort search filter  on your customer table, you will need to find the sql command for each of these --
-- Working with the machine is self - marking - the machine gives you feedback! --
-- You need an SQL reference to look up SQL commands - w3shools is one, we will collect a list of others.

----
Lets go again with a new table
Create a table to store information about customer dogs,  dog_size = small, medium, larg
(dog_id, dog_name, dog_breed, dog_size, dog_notes, owner_fname, owner_sname, owner_mobile, owner_email)


-- Lets have someone in the class organise a data list of 10 records, paste a couple of records each into the chat, someone can collate. 

-- Now add edit delete sort search filter, on your dogs table ---

--Activity Check --
-- Using SQL commands and SQLite3 I can now 
---Create a table
---Add data to the table
---Perform basic data operations of add edit delete sort search and filter.
